## Why I Chose To Use Redux
One of my reasons was because I have heard about how great it is for dealing with state. After quite a bit of research, I decided to incorporate it because:
* It's lightweight (App's asset size increase is minimal)
* The idea of a "container" or "store" for state was intriguing
* Data in the app is shared amongst different components which could in turn make where to put state a bit confusing
* I wanted to learn it (The primary reason)
