## Why I Chose To Use Redux
 After quite a bit of research, I decided to incorporate it because:
* It's lightweight (App's asset size increase is minimal)
* The idea of a "container" or "store" for state was intriguing
* Data in the app is shared amongst different components which could in turn make where to put state a bit confusing. Instead of state having to climb up and down the component tree, components could use state directly.
* I wanted to learn it (The primary reason)

This was tougher than I expected, but with a lot of help from StackOverflow, YouTube, Redux docs, and kind person from a JS group out of San Diego (who wished to remain anonymous), I was able to incorporate it into my app.
